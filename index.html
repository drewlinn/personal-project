    <h2>About the world</h2>
      <li>The Story</li>
      <p>Aegis is a fantasy setting I have been developing since I was a small child. My intent is to eventually design interactive Role-Playing Video Games with involving stories and branching narratives that take place in this setting. It intentionally resembles a lot of other contemporary fantasy for numerous reasons; partially so that I can make specific socially and philosophically commentative points about the real world and society, and also because those are the kinds of stories that have deeply inspired me throughout my life.</p>
